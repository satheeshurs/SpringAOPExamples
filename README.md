Aspect-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns.
It does so by adding additional behavior to existing code (an advice) without modifying the code itself.

Aspect: A modularization of a concern that cuts across multiple classes
